Synthetic Dataset For Risk Assessment and Loan Approval Modeling
This synthetic dataset comprises 20,000 records of personal and financial data, designed to facilitate the development of predictive models for risk assessment.The dataset includes diverse features such as demographic information, credicxt history, employment status, income levels, existing debt, and other relevant financial metrics, providing a comprehensive foundation for sophisticated data-driven analysis and decision-making.

It serves two primary purposes:

Risk Score Regression: To predict a continuous risk score associated with each individual's likelihood of loan default or financial instability.
